    * Version 1.0
      This is the first public version of textmiditools
      including rewrites of AlgoRhythms as textmidicgm,
      smusmidi as smustextmidi, mididisasm as miditext,
      and textmidi.
    * Version 1.0.1
    * Version 1.0.2
    * Version 1.0.3
      Fix a length problem: using a generated form using
      textmidicgm --random, the rhythms were very unusual
      and reveal a time-counting issue in the note-event
      generating loop in Composer.cc.
