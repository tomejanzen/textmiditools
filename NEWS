    * Version 1.0
      This is the first public version of textmiditools
      including rewrites of AlgoRhythms as textmidicgm,
      smusmidi as smustextmidi, mididisasm as miditext,
      and textmidi.
    * Version 1.0.1
    * Version 1.0.2
    * Version 1.0.3
      Fix a length problem: using a generated form using
      textmidicgm --random, the rhythms were very unusual
      and reveal a time-counting issue in the note-event
      generating loop in Composer.cc.
    * Version 1.0.4
      Update documentation for texmidicgm.
      Random forms now have a set .125 probability of silence,
      for walking voices.
      Panning for random forms has been fixed so that
      if there is only one channel it won't land on the
      far right of the audio field.
    * Version 1.0.5
      Fix bug of random forms getting different program
      assignments on different voices that have the same
      MIDI channel.   There must be a (single-valued relation) 
      function from MIDI channel to program.
    * Version 1.0.6
      Add textmidiformedit.py and its associated python files,
      to make it possible to graphically edit musical forms
      for use by textmidicgm to compose random music.
      Also added previously omitted B's from the chromatic
      scale in textmidicgm for making random forms.
    * Version 1.0.7
      Fix form plot's unside-down mean curves, and add a 
      Postscript menu item.
