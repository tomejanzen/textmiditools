This collection of files will build into the Molto vivace of
the d minor symphony (the 9th symphony) of Ludwig van Beethoven
as transcribed for piano solo by Franz Liszt.
The make file requires the m4 macro processor and the 
TextMIDITools program textmidi, currently on github.

To build, first build and install the program textmidi.
Then, 
    make -f lvb9_2.make

MIDI Program 1 is set to specify a grand piano sound from
General MIDI.

This is a replacement in textmidi language for a version uploaded
in 1994 to the Classical MIDI Archives, now the Classical Archives.
This replacement was done in 2021 and prepared for github in 2024.
The 1994 version was done in Electronic Arts' Deluxe Music Construction
Set; the rendering is highly mechanical and seems to have 
MIDI file errors (primarily missing NOTE-OFFs).
The file was saved as an SMUS (Simple Musical Score) and converted
to MIDI with Thomas Janzen's tool SMUSMIDI.
This version is not included here.
