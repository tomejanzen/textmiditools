This collection of files will build into Beethoven's Grosse Fuge
for string quartet, as transcribed for piano four hands by
Beethoven himself, then arranged for General MIDI idiophone
percussion by Thomas E. Janzen.

The make file requires the m4 macro processor and the 
TextMIDITools program textmidi, currently on github under TextMIDITools.

To build, first build and install the program textmidi.
Then, 
    make -f grossefuge.make
