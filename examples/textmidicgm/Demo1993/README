What is this?

General Information

The files herein are (C++ library) boost::serialization XML archive files
of the demo pieces for the original version of the textmidicgm program,
written for the Commodore Amiga computer running AmigaDOS.
These pieces were rendered on the Amiga and recorded to a cassette audio
tape master, then distributed in small numbers (probably fewer than 20
copies) to associates.  The first demo cassette was created in about 1990,
but the files herein represent the 1993 demo tape.
They have been hand-tooled to sound close to the way they sounded
in 1993, more or less.

The original program from 1990 for the Commodore Amiga, "AlgoRhythms",
played in real-time to MIDI instruments and Amiga audio channels.
The MIDI connection acted as a throttle on the event rates.
Therefore many of the form files had "0" for the min_note_len.
It could play at the maximum rate MIDI offered (ca. 400 notes/sec),
and cause at least one piano synthesizer to lock up.
You can prevent this in you form files by using a non-zero
min_note_len, or by offsetting the rhythm curve a bit high.
In a static condition (a very long rhythm mean period),
you may set the rhythm mean phase away from -pi/2.

The program textmidicgm is a batch program and does produce
very short notes.  At first blush, it appears that they are
restricted to 1 MIDI tick and note zero, but I have looked further.
In any case, this feature might produce very large files without
looking ahead for whether there is room.  Therefore I have added
a limit of 100,000 notes at the line Composer.cc:331.
This produces files of over 800k bytes.

These files are compatible with the form editor textmidiformedit.py.

Makefile will build the textmidi files and then the MIDI files if
the utilities textmidicgm and textmidi have been installed.

======================================================================
Features
======================================================================
The files serve as demonstrations of the textmidicgm program.
They demonstrate use of various keyboard-based scales and textmidicgm
features.  None of them demonstrate follower voices because followers
were not part of the Amiga version of the software.
