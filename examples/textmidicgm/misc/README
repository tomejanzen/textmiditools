What is this?
======================================================================

General Information

The files herein are (C++ library) boost::serialization XML archive files
of the demo pieces for the original version of the textmidicgm program,
written for the Commodore Amiga computer running AmigaDOS.
They have been hand-tooled to sound close to the way they sounded
in 1993, more or less.

The original program from 1990 for the Commodore Amiga, "AlgoRhythms",
played in real-time to MIDI instruments and Amiga audio channels.
The MIDI connection acted as a throttle on the event rates.
Therefore many of the form files had "0" for the min_note_len.
It could play at the maximum rate MIDI offered (ca. 400 notes/sec),
and cause at least one piano synthesizer to lock up.
You can prevent this in you form files by using a non-zero
min_note_len, or by offsetting the rhythm curve a bit high.
In a static condition (a very long rhythm mean period),
you may set the rhythm mean phase away from -pi/2.

These files are compatible with the form editor textmidiformedit.py.

Makefile will build the textmidi files and then the MIDI files if
the utilities textmidicgm and textmidi have been installed.

Features
======================================================================
The files serve as demonstrations of the textmidicgm program.
They demonstrate use of various keyboard-based scales and textmidicgm
features.  None of them demonstrate follower voices because followers
were not part of the Amiga version of the software.

pure8:
  pure8 is an example of a meditative piece that makes use of long tones
  (as wind players have it) or in MIDI, breath control (or pressure
  or after touch).  Since textmidicgm does not produce the necessary
  pressure commands, they have to be added by editing the textmidi language
  output of textmidicgm.
  Files: 
    pure8.bash : script to produce pure8.mid.
    pure8.xml : The form file for pure8
    addincludes.sed : Defines a macro named polypressure (just to be "true"); 
      adds an m4 macro processor include directive to read in longtonechan.m4.
    longtone_and_channel.sed : a sed file that replaces each appearance of a 
      velocity and note or just a note into a call to longtone().  This m4 file
      does not work for all textmidi files because it must have lines that contain 
      either a note and rhythm, or a vel command, a velocity, and a note and rhythm.  
      Also it will not handle dynamic symbols such as forte and pp correctly, but 
      textmidicgm does not produce dynamic symbols.  It also defines "thechannel"
      as -1, and adds an increment of it at the beginning of each track.  The 
      channel numbers of the tracks should match those channels by setting the 
      channel in the form file to 1 in the first track, 2 in the next, 3 in the 
      next, and so on.  The channels for each track must differ because this 
      macro uses the CHANNEL_PRESSURE command and not POLY_KEY_PRESSURE, which 
      is particular to a key name (such as C#4).  Various MIDI hardware and 
      software differs in whether it supports CHANNEL_PRESSURE or POLY_KEY_PRESSURE.
      Support of POLY_KEY_PRESSURE appears to be less common than that for CHANNEL_PRESSURE.
      
    longtonechan.m4 : an m4 include file that defines a macro named longtone
      which expands a note name and rhythm into a series of textmidi
      CHANNEL_PRESSURE commands.
