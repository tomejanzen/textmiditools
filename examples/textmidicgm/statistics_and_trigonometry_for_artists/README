What is this?
======================================================================

General Information

The files herein are (C++ library) boost::serialization XML archive files
of the demo pieces for the original version of the textmidicgm program,
written for the Commodore Amiga computer running AmigaDOS.
They were all part of a cassette album passed around to a few associates,
entitled "Statistics and Trigonometry for Artists".
They have been hand-tooled in 2024 to sound close to the way they sounded
in 1990, more or less.

The original program from 1990 for the Commodore Amiga, "AlgoRhythms",
played in real-time to MIDI instruments and Amiga audio channels.
The MIDI connection acted as a throttle on the event rates.
Therefore many of the form files had "0" for the min_note_len.
It could play at the maximum rate MIDI offered (ca. 400 notes/sec),
and cause at least one piano synthesizer to lock up.
You can prevent this in you form files by using a non-zero
min_note_len, or by offsetting the rhythm curve a bit high.
In a static condition (a very long rhythm mean period),
you may set the rhythm mean phase away from -pi/2.

These files are compatible with the form editor textmidiformedit.py.

The file Makefile will build the textmidi files and then the MIDI files if
the utilities textmidicgm and textmidi have been installed: 

    make

Features
======================================================================
The files serve as demonstrations of the textmidicgm program.
They demonstrate use of various keyboard-based scales and textmidicgm
features.  None of them demonstrate follower voices because followers
were not part of the Amiga version of the software.
