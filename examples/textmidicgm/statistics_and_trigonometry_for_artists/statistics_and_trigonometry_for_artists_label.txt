These works were improvised by computer using a technique known as algorithm
composition.  The general character and progress of the works were specified by
the composer, but the exact pitches, durations, and dynamics were selected
moment-to-moent by the computer software in real time while it played the music
through a computer-controlled synthesizer.  Janzen wrote the algorithmic
composition software in the C computer language.
