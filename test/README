What is this?
======================================================================

General Information

TextMIDITools/test is a test script and 7 lists of MIDI files from the
classical archive (https://www.classicalarchives.com).  These MIDI
files are not provided here but seem to still be available from
classicalarchives.com.

The converters are:
textmidi - convert a text representation of a MIDI file into a binary
           standard MIDI file.
miditext - convert a binary standard MIDI file into a text representation.

The smustextmidi program is not tested by textmidiroundtriptest.py.

Run as follows:

./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives0.txt
./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives1.txt
./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives2.txt
./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives3.txt
./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives4.txt
./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives5.txt
./textmidiroundtriptest.py classical_archives6.txt

At this time, all textmidi file pairs match exactly, and 98-99% of
MIDI files compare exactly.  Those that do not match are assumed
to be MIDI files that violate the MIDI SMF specification and will
probably not be investigated further.

Features
======================================================================

* textmidiroundtriptest.py
  + Uses the textmidi utility to convert an original MIDI file to a
  textmidi file, then
  + Uses the miditext utility to convert the resulting textmidi file
  back into a Standard MIDI File, then
  + Uses the textmidi utility to convert the second MIDI file to
  a second textmidi file, then
  + compares the original and converted MIDI file, then
  + compares the first and second textmidi files.
  + Reports the total number of input files, and the percentages
  of identical pairs of MIDI and textmidi files.
  + As it operates on each file, reports if one of the comparisons
  fails and gives the name of the failing files.
  + Since some, especially older, MIDI files violate the
  way that MIDI running status is to be used, the textmidi program
  and the textmidiroundtriptest.py script support the writing of
  MIDI files that misuse running status in the same way, so that
  files can be made to match, showing that there are no other
  differences.   The different running status policies are:
      1. standard; textmidi's interpretation of the spec
         The file list should read either:
         classical_archives/bach/BachAnnaMagdalenaNotebook/6/3men.mid
         or
         classical_archives/bach/BachAnnaMagdalenaNotebook/6/3men.mid,standard
      2. never; also put out the status byte (the command+channel).
         Hence the file list line should read:
           classical_archives/bach/BachAnnaMagdalenaNotebook/0/anna-18.mid,never
      3. persistentaftermeta; MIDI META events do not reset running status
         The file list line should read:
         classical_archives/bach/Bach_BWV1000-1013/4/chacona.mid,persistentaftermeta
      4. persistentaftersysex; MIDI SYSEX events do not reset running status
      5. persistentaftersysexormeta; neither SYSEX or META events reset running status
  The MIDI files used were downloaded or purchased by about 2005; it possible that
  some of them were later repaired, replaced, or deleted.

Where to get a copy
======================================================================

The latest release of TextMIDITools are available at:
github.

======================================================================
How to install
======================================================================

The test files are not installed in a system area but may be run
from the path to which the package was de-archived.

textmidiroundtriptest.py is written to work on linux and uses the diff utility.
